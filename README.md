Up-to-date Prebuilt RISCV GNU toolchain for painless setup. No more build from source everytime.



This repository makes use of GitHub actions to build the `riscv-gnu-toolchain` from source. Just download the prebuilt binaries, add to path and use.

## Installation
// Coming soon

## TODO:

- [ ] Build for both `newlib` and `linux` toolchains
- [ ] Trigger rebuild upon new release from source to stay up to date.
- [ ] Multiple extensions and variants support
